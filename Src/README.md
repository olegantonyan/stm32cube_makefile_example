# STM32CubeMX-generated project with Makefile example
This is an example project generated by STM32CubeMX for STM32F103. The whole point of it is to show an example `Makefile`.

## Why

For those who use Linux and don't want to use Eclipse-based IDEs.

## Installation
You'll need GNU ARM toolchain (https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads). Add its path to `Makefile`.

You can use st-link programmer (https://github.com/texane/stlink), see `flash` target in `Makefile`.

## Usage
Fork it. Play around. Have fun with it.
